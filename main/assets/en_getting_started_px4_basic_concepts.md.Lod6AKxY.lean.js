These are used, for example, to automate common tasks like takeoff, returning to the home position, and landing. Other autonomous modes execute pre-programmed missions, follow a GPS beacon, or accept commands from an offboard computer or ground station.</p><p><em>Manual modes</em> are controlled by the user (via the RC control sticks/joystick) with assistance from the autopilot.
