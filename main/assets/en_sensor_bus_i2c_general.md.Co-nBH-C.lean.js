The bus is of open-drain type, meaning that devices ground the data line. It uses a pullup resistor to push it to <code>log.1</code> (idle state) - every wire has it usually located on the bus terminating devices. One bus can connect to multiple I2C devices. The individual devices are connected without any crossing.</p><p>For connection (according to dronecode standard) 4-wire cables equipped with JST-GH connectors are used. To ensure reliable communication and to reduce crosstalk it is advised to apply recommendations concerning <a href="./../assembly/cable_wiring.html#i2c-cables">cable twisting</a> and pullup resistors placement.</p><p><img src="'+a+'" alt="Cable twisting"></p><h2 id="checking-the-bus-and-device-status" tabindex="-1">Checking the Bus and Device Status <a class="header-anchor" href="#checking-the-bus-and-device-status" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Checking the Bus and Device Status&quot;">​</a></h2><p>A useful tool for bus analysis is <a href="./../modules/modules_command.html#i2cdetect">i2cdetect</a>.

This usually occurs because a user needs to attach two sensors of the same type to the bus, but may also happen if devices use duplicate addresses by default.</p><p>Particular I2C devices may allow you to select a new address for one of the devices to avoid the clash. Some devices do not support this option, or do not have broad options for the addresses that can be used (i.e. cannot be used to avoid a clash).</p><p>If you can&#39;t change the addresses, one option is to use an <a href="#i2c-address-translators">I2C Address Translator</a>.</p><h3 id="insufficient-transfer-capacity" tabindex="-1">Insufficient Transfer Capacity <a class="header-anchor" href="#insufficient-transfer-capacity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Insufficient Transfer Capacity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The bandwidth available for each individual device generally decreases as more devices are added. The exact decrease depends on the bandwidth used by each individual device.
