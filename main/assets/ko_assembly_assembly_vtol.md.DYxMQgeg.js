Typical wiring for power and control is shown below.</p><p><img src="'+g+'" alt="Servo wiring"></p><p>PWM servos have a three wire connector that provides both power and PWM control signals (the middle pin is the power/voltage high). You can connect the servo outputs to any pins or bus you like, and later on configure what the output actually does in PX4.</p><p>The power rail cannot be powered by the FC itself! A battery elimination circuit may be used to provide a regulated voltage from the battery to the middle &quot;Power&quot; rail on the PWM output bus, which in turn powers all connected servos.</p><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>The power rail can only have the one voltage provided by your BEC. If you don&#39;t use servos that all accept the same voltage, you&#39;ll need to separately power those that use a different voltage.</p></div><h2 id="기타-주변-장치" tabindex="-1">기타 주변 장치 <a class="header-anchor" href="#기타-주변-장치" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;기타 주변 장치&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Other peripherals, such as high-power radios, cameras, and so on have their own power requirements.
