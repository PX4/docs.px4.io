For PWM the pulse length typically ranges between 1000us (zero) and 2000us (full power), while for OneShot 125 the pulse widths are 8 times shorter, ranging from 125us (zero power) to 250us (full power).</p><p>The theoretical maximum rate at which pulses can be sent, and hence the responsiveness, depends on the width of the largest pulse. For PWM this rate is close to 500 Hz while for OneShot it approaches 4 kHz. In practice the actual maximum rate for OneShot ESCs is typically between 1 kHz and 2 kHz, depending on the ESC used.</p><h2 id="设置" tabindex="-1">设置 <a class="header-anchor" href="#设置" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;设置&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="布线" tabindex="-1">布线 <a class="header-anchor" href="#布线" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;布线&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Wiring is exactly the same as for <a href="./../peripherals/pwm_escs_and_servo.html">PWM ESCs</a> (and dshot).</p><h3 id="px4-配置" tabindex="-1">PX4 配置 <a class="header-anchor" href="#px4-配置" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;PX4 配置&quot;">​</a></h3><p>To enable OneShot select the protocol for a group of outputs during <a href="./../config/actuators.html">Actuator Configuration</a>.
