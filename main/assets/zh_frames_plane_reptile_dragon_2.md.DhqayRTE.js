The RD2 instructions will note that each control surface uses a specific length of linkage (included in the kit). Make sure to measure each linkage before installation to be sure that it is the right length linkage for that control surface. It&#39;s very important to align the servos such that the mechanical range of the servo is well aligned with the mechanical range of the control surface. When the servo is at it&#39;s center point, the servo arm should be at a 90 degree angle to the servo, and the control surface should be roughly centered. It might not be possible to get this alignment perfect, so any remaining offset will be adjusted out in software.</p><p>The following steps can be used to perform servo alignment:</p><ol><li>Begin with the servo outside of the airplane</li><li>Use the servo tester to move the servo to its center point</li><li>Install the servo horn with the included retaining screw, taking care to align the horn to extend as close as possible to 90 degrees out on the correct side of the servo</li><li>Install the servo in the servo pocket on the airplane</li><li>Install the linkage, and twist to adjust it such that the control surface is as close to centered as possible</li></ol><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The servo horn will likely not sit exactly at a 90 degree angle to the servo due to the teeth on the servo shaft.

The supplied <a href="#parameter-config">params file</a> maps the actuators as described in this build.</p><p>The RD2 kit comes with clockwise and counter clockwise propellers for counter rotating motors. With counter rotating props, the airplane can be set up such that it has no <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_engine" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">critical motors</a>.</p><p>With no critical motors, controllability will be maximized if a motor fails. The motor direction should be set such that props should turn towards the fuselage on top of the plane. In other words, if you look at the left motor with the airplane facing away from you, it should spin clockwise while the right motor should spin counter clockwise.</p><p>With the propellers removed, power the airplane up and use the <a href="./../config/actuators.html">Actuator</a> test in QGC to spin up the motors. If the left or right motor does not spin in the correct direction, swap two of its ESC leads and check it again. Finally, when both motors are spinning the correct directions, use a wrench to attach the propellers.</p><h2 id="final-checks" tabindex="-1">Final Checks <a class="header-anchor" href="#final-checks" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Final Checks&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Prior to the first flight, a comprehensive preflight must be conducted.</p><p>I recommend checking the following items:</p><ul><li>Sensor calibration (QGC) <ul><li>Mag calibration</li><li>Accelerometer calibration</li><li>Airspeed calibration</li><li>Level horizon calibration</li></ul></li><li>Check control surface deflection</li><li>Right stick -&gt; Right aileron goes up, left aileron goes down</li><li>Left stick -&gt; Left aileron goes up, right aileron goes down</li><li>Stick back -&gt; elevator goes up -Stick forward -&gt; elevator goes down</li><li>Left rudder -&gt; Rudder goes left</li><li>Right rudder -&gt; Rudder goes right</li><li>Check Px4 inputs (in <code>stabilized mode</code>)</li><li>Roll right -&gt; Right Aileron goes down</li><li>Roll left -&gt; Left aileron goes down</li><li>Pitch up -&gt; Elevator goes down</li><li>Pitch down -&gt; Elevator goes up</li></ul><h2 id="第一次飞行" tabindex="-1">第一次飞行 <a class="header-anchor" href="#第一次飞行" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;第一次飞行&quot;">​</a></h2><p>I recommend performing the first takeoff in manual mode. Because this airplane has no landing gear, you will either need to throw the airplane yourself, or ideally have a helper throw it. When throwing any airplane, throw at a slightly nose up attitude with full throttle.</p><p>It&#39;s critical to be ready to give aft stick input to prevent the airplane from impacting the ground if it happens to be trimmed nosedown. Once the airplane is successfully airborne, cruise up to an altitude of a few hundred feet and switch to <a href="./../flight_modes_fw/acro.html">Acro mode</a>. This is a good time to use <a href="./../config/autotune_fw.html">Autotuning</a> to tune the airframe.</p><p>If the airplane is well behaved in <em>Acro mode</em>, switch to <a href="./../flight_modes_fw/position.html">Position mode</a>.</p><h2 id="build-results-performance" tabindex="-1">Build Results &amp; Performance <a class="header-anchor" href="#build-results-performance" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Build Results &amp; Performance&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Overall, this build was a success.
