The altitude estimate will go down, because the IMU has in fact moved down. As a reaction, the altitude controller will give more thrust to compensate. The amplitude depends on how far the IMU is located from the CoG. It might be negligible, but it is still some unneeded control effort that is constantly applied. If the offsets are specified, a pure pitch motion would not create any change in the altitude estimate so there will be less parasitic corrections.</p></details><h2 id="振动隔离" tabindex="-1">振动隔离 <a class="header-anchor" href="#振动隔离" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;振动隔离&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Flight Control boards with in-built accelerometers or gyros are sensitive to vibrations.
