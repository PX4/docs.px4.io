The remote has physical controls that can be used to specify vehicle movement (e.g. speed, direction, throttle, yaw, pitch, roll, etc.) and to enable autopilot <a href="./../flight_modes/">flight modes</a> (e.g. takeoff, land, return to land, mission etc.). On <em>telemetry-enabled</em> RC systems, the remote control unit can also receive and display information from the vehicle, such as battery level, flight mode, and warnings.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="Taranis X9D Transmitter"></p><p>The ground based RC controller contains a radio module that is bound to, and communicates with, a (compatible) radio module on the vehicle. The vehicle-based unit is connected to the flight controller. The flight controller determines how to interpret the commands based on the current autopilot flight mode and vehicle state, and drives the vehicle motors and actuators appropriately.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The ground- and vehicle- based radio modules are referred to as the transmitter and receiver respectively (even if they support bidirectional communication) and are collectively referred to as a <em>transmitter/receiver pair</em>. The RC controller and it&#39;s included radio module are commonly referred to as a &quot;transmitter&quot;.</p></div><p>An important quality of an RC system is how many &quot;channels&quot; it supports. The number of channels defines how many different physical controls on the remote control can be used to send commands to the vehicle (e.g. how many switches, dials, control sticks can actually be used).</p><p>An aircraft must use a system that supports at least 4 channels (for roll, pitch, yaw, thrust). Ground vehicles need at least two channels (steering + throttle). An 8 or 16 channel transmitter provides additional channels that can be used to control other mechanisms or activate different <a href="./../flight_modes/">flight modes</a> provided by the autopilot.</p><h2 id="types-of-remote-controllers" tabindex="-1">Types of Remote Controllers <a class="header-anchor" href="#types-of-remote-controllers" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Types of Remote Controllers&quot;">​</a></h2><p><a id="transmitter_modes"></a></p><h3 id="remote-control-units-for-aircraft" tabindex="-1">Remote Control Units for Aircraft <a class="header-anchor" href="#remote-control-units-for-aircraft" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Remote Control Units for Aircraft&quot;">​</a></h3><p>The most popular <em>form</em> of remote control unit for UAVs is shown below.
