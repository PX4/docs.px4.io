Some of the types, along with the use cases for which they are most suited are listed below.</p><ul><li><a href="./../frames_multicopter/">Multicopters</a> — Multi-rotors offer precision hovering and vertical takeoff, at the cost of shorter and generally slower flight. They are the most popular type of flying vehicle, in part because they are easy to assemble, and PX4 has modes that make them easy to fly and very suitable as a camera platform.</li><li><a href="./../frames_helicopter/">Helicopters</a> — Helicopters similar benefits to Multicopters but are mechanically more complex and more efficient. They are also much harder to fly.</li><li><a href="./../frames_plane/">Planes (Fixed-wing)</a> — Fixed-wing vehicles offer longer and faster flight than multicopters, and hence better coverage for ground surveys etc. However they are harder to fly and land than multicopters, and aren&#39;t suitable if you need to hover or fly very slowly (e.g. when surveying vertical structures).</li><li><a href="./../frames_vtol/">VTOL</a> (Vertical Takeoff and Landing) - Hybrid Fixed-wing/Multicopter vehicles offer the best of both worlds: take off in vertical mode and hover like a multicopter but transition to forward flight like an airplane to cover more ground. VTOL are often more expensive than either multicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, and harder to build and tune. They come in a number of types: tiltrotors, tailsitters, quadplanes etc.</li><li><a href="./../frames_airship/">Airships</a>/<a href="./../frames_balloon/">Balloons</a> — Lighter-than-air vehicles that typically offer high altitude long duration flight, often at the cost of having limited (or no) control over speed and direction of flight.</li><li><a href="./../frames_rover/">Rovers</a> — Car-like ground vehicles. They are simple to control and often fun to use.
