The vehicle then turns on the motors and operates according to its current mode.</p><p>When throw launch is enabled, arming the vehicle does not cause the propellers to spin. The propellors will not activate until the vehicle is thrown or is disarmed, and the arming tone will continue playing during this time. The vehicle will not automatically disarm after arming, and must be manually disarmed if you choose not to throw it.</p><p>The vehicle detects that it has been thrown based on reaching a certain speed (5m/s), and then starts the motors at the apex of the throw (once it determines that it has started to fall). You need to throw the vehicle high enough so that it can stabilize its height well before falling anywhere near people or obstacles.</p><p>Notes:</p><ul><li>The mode is disabled by default, and must be enabled using a <a href="#parameters">parameter</a> before arming.</li><li>When enabled you cannot take off from the ground using the normal modes.</li><li>The vehicle should not be transported after being armed and before the throw. In particular, the throw should not be executed from a moving platform. The reason for this is that the condition to start the motors depends on absolute speed of the multicopter and does not account for any additional movement. Trying to throw the drone from a moving platform might result in the motors being started prematurely.</li></ul><h2 id="safety" tabindex="-1">Safety <a class="header-anchor" href="#safety" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Safety&quot;">​</a></h2><div class="warning custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">WARNING</p><p>Throw launch is dangerous as it requires the operator to hold an armed multicopter and be in proximity when it is flying.</p></div><p>Before testing, make sure that the aircraft can take off with the normal position or takeoff modes.
