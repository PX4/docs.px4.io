This is handy if you lose the orientation or need a brake. It can also be used to land safely.</li><li><a href="./../flight_modes_mc/return.html">Return mode</a> can be used, either on a switch or as RC loss/low battery failsafe.</li><li>You will have the last position when it crashes.</li><li>The log contains the flight track, which means you can review the flight (in 3D).

If you need complete build instructions, you can follow the <a href="./../frames_multicopter/qav_r_5_kiss_esc_racer.html">QAV-R 5&quot; KISS ESC Racer</a> build log.</p><h3 id="vibration-setup" tabindex="-1">Vibration Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#vibration-setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Vibration Setup&quot;">​</a></h3><p>There are various mounting approaches to reduce vibrations. For example, the flight controller can be mounted with vibration dampening foam, or using <a href="./../frames_multicopter/qav_r_5_kiss_esc_racer.html#mounting">O-rings</a>.</p><p>While there is no single best method, you will typically have fewer problems with vibrations if you use high-quality components (frame, motors, props) as for example used in the <a href="./../frames_multicopter/qav_r_5_kiss_esc_racer.html">QAV-R 5&quot; KISS ESC Racer</a>.</p><p>Make sure to use <strong>balanced props</strong>.</p><h3 id="center-of-gravity" tabindex="-1">Center of Gravity <a class="header-anchor" href="#center-of-gravity" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Center of Gravity&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Make sure that the center of gravity is as close as possible to the center of thrust. Left-right balance is usually not a problem, but front-back balance may be. You can move the battery until it is correct and mark it on the frame so you will always place it correctly.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The integral term can account for an imbalanced setup, and a custom mixer can do that even better. However it is best to fix any imbalance as part of the vehicle setup.</p></div><h2 id="software-setup" tabindex="-1">Software Setup <a class="header-anchor" href="#software-setup" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Software Setup&quot;">​</a></h2><p>After having built the racer, you will need to configure the software.</p><p>Go through the <a href="./../config/">Basic Configuration Guide</a>. In particular, set the <a href="./../config/airframe.html">Airframe</a> that most closely matches your frame (typically you will choose the <a href="./../airframes/airframe_reference.html#copter_quadrotor_x_generic_250_racer">Generic 250 Racer</a> airframe, which sets some racer-specific parameters by default).</p><p>These parameters are important:</p><ul><li>Enable One-Shot or DShot by selecting the protocol for a group of outputs during <a href="./../config/actuators.html">Actuator Configuration</a>.</li><li>Set the maximum roll-, pitch- and yaw rates for Manual/Stabilized mode as desired: <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MC_ROLLRATE_MAX">MC_ROLLRATE_MAX</a>, <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MC_PITCHRATE_MAX">MC_PITCHRATE_MAX</a> and <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MC_YAWRATE_MAX">MC_YAWRATE_MAX</a>. The maximum tilt angle is configured with <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MPC_MAN_TILT_MAX">MPC_MAN_TILT_MAX</a>.</li><li>The minimum thrust <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#MPC_MANTHR_MIN">MPC_MANTHR_MIN</a> should be set to 0.</li></ul><h3 id="estimator" tabindex="-1">Estimator <a class="header-anchor" href="#estimator" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Estimator&quot;">​</a></h3><p>If you use a GPS you can skip this section and use the default estimator. Otherwise you should switch to the Q attitude estimator, which works without a magnetometer or barometer.</p><p>To enable it set <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#ATT_EN">ATT_EN = 1</a>, <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#EKF2_EN">EKF2_EN =0 </a> and <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#LPE_EN">LPE_EN = 0</a> (for more information see <a href="./../advanced/switching_state_estimators.html#how-to-enable-different-estimators">Switching State Estimators</a>).</p><p>Then change the following parameters:</p><ul><li>Set <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#SYS_HAS_MAG">SYS_HAS_MAG</a> to <code>0</code> if the system does not have a magnetometer.</li><li>Set <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#SYS_HAS_BARO">SYS_HAS_BARO</a> to <code>0</code> if the system does not have a barometer.</li><li>Configure the Q estimator: set <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#ATT_ACC_COMP">ATT_ACC_COMP</a> to <code>0</code>, <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#ATT_W_ACC">ATT_W_ACC</a> to 0.4 and <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#ATT_W_GYRO_BIAS">ATT_W_GYRO_BIAS</a> to 0.

If you do not use a GPS, set the failsafe to <strong>Lockdown</strong>, which turns off the motors. Test RC loss on the bench without props attached by turning off the remote when the vehicle is armed.</p><p>Make sure to assign a <a href="./../config/safety.html#kill-switch">kill switch</a> or an <a href="./../config/safety.html#arm-disarm-switch">arming switch</a>. Test it and train to use it!</p><h3 id="pid-tuning" tabindex="-1">PID Tuning <a class="header-anchor" href="#pid-tuning" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;PID Tuning&quot;">​</a></h3><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>Make sure to calibrate the ESCs before doing any tuning.</p></div><p>At this point you should be ready for a first test flight.</p><p>Assuming the vehicle is able to fly using the default settings, we then do a first pass of <a href="./../config_mc/pid_tuning_guide_multicopter_basic.html">Basic MC PID tuning</a>. The vehicle needs to be <strong>undertuned</strong> (the <strong>P</strong> and <strong>D</strong> gains should be set too low), such that there are no oscillations from the controller that could be interpreted as noise (the default gains might be good enough).
