They are loosely grouped into <em>manual</em>, <em>assisted</em> and <em>auto</em> modes, based on the level/type of control provided by the autopilot. The pilot transitions between flight modes using switches on the remote control or with a ground control station.</p><p>Not all flight modes are available on all vehicle types, and some modes behave differently on different vehicle types (as described below). Finally, some flight modes make sense only under specific pre-flight and in-flight conditions (e.g. GPS lock). The system will not allow transitions to those modes until the right conditions are met.</p><p>The sections below provide an overview of the modes, followed by a <a href="#flight-mode-evaluation-diagram">flight mode evaluation diagram</a> that shows the conditions under which PX4 will transition into a new mode.</p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>User-facing flight mode documentation can be found in:</p><ul><li><a href="./../flight_modes_mc/">Flight Modes (Multicopter)</a></li><li><a href="./../flight_modes_fw/">Flight Modes (Fixed-Wing)</a></li><li><a href="./../flight_modes_vtol/">Flight Modes (VTOL)</a></li><li><a href="./../flight_modes_rover/">Flight/Drive Modes (Rover)</a></li></ul></div><h2 id="flight-mode-summary" tabindex="-1">Flight Mode Summary <a class="header-anchor" href="#flight-mode-summary" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Flight Mode Summary&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="manual-flight-modes" tabindex="-1">Manual Flight Modes <a class="header-anchor" href="#manual-flight-modes" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Manual Flight Modes&quot;">​</a></h3><p>&quot;Manual&quot; modes are those where the user has direct control over the vehicle via the RC control (or joystick). Vehicle movement always follows stick movement, but the level/type of response changes depending on the mode. For example, experienced fliers can use modes that provide direct passthrough of stick positions to actuators, while beginners will often choose modes that are less responsive to sudden stick-position changes.</p><ul><li><p><strong>Rovers / Boats:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>MANUAL/STABILIZED/ACRO:</strong> The pilot&#39;s control inputs (raw user inputs from RC transmitter) are passed directly to control allocation.</li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Fixed-wing aircraft:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>MANUAL:</strong> The pilot&#39;s control inputs (raw user inputs from RC transmitter) are passed directly to control allocation.</li><li><strong>STABILIZED:</strong> The pilot&#39;s pitch and roll inputs are passed as angle commands to the autopilot, while the yaw input is sent directly via control allocation to the rudder (manual control). If the RC roll and pitch sticks are centered, the autopilot regulates the roll and pitch angles to zero, hence stabilizing (leveling-out) the attitude against any wind disturbances. However, in this mode the position of the aircraft is not controlled by the autopilot, hence the position can drift due to wind. With nonzero roll input the vehicle does a coordinated turn to achieve zero sideslip (the acceleration in y-direction (sidewards) is zero). During a coordinated turn, the rudder is used to control the sideslip and any manual yaw input is added to that.</li><li><strong>ACRO:</strong> The pilot&#39;s inputs are passed as roll, pitch, and yaw <em>rate</em> commands to the autopilot.
