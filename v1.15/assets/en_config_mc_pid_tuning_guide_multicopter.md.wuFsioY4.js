The motor command in PX4 called <code>actuator_output</code> can be PWM, Dshot, UAVCAN commands for the respective ESCs in use. <a href="https://github.com/PX4/PX4-user_guide/blob/v1.15/assets/config/mc/ThrustCurve.ipynb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">This Notebook</a> shows one way for how the thrust model factor <code>THR_MDL_FAC</code> may be calculated from previously measured thrust and PWM data. The curves shown in this plot are parametrized by both α and k, and also show thrust and PWM in real units (kgf and μs).

An example of that graph is shown here:</p><p><img src="'+l+'" alt="Graph showing relative thrust and PWM scatter"></p><p>If raw motor command and thrust data is collected throughout the full-scale range in the experiment, you can normalize the data using the equation:</p><p><em>normalized_value = ( raw_value - min (raw_value) ) / ( max ( raw_value ) - min ( raw_value ) )</em></p><p>After you have a scatter plot of the normalized values, you can try and make the curve match by plotting the equation</p><p>_rel_thrust = ( <code>THR_MDL_FAC</code> ) _ rel<em>signal^2 + ( 1 - <code>THR_MDL_FAC</code> ) * rel</em>signal*</p><p>over a linear range of normalized motor command values between 0 and 1. Note that this is the equation that is used in the firmware to map thrust and motor command, as shown in the <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#THR_MDL_FAC">THR_MDL_FAC</a> parameter reference. Here, <em>rel_thrust</em> is the normalized thrust value between 0 and 1, and <em>rel_signal</em> is the normalized motor command signal value between 0 and 1.</p><p>In this example above, the curve seemed to fit best when <code>THR_MDL_FAC</code> was set to 0.7.</p><p>If you don&#39;t have access to a thrust stand, you can also tune the modeling factor empirically. Start off with 0.3 and increase it by 0.1 at a time. If it is too high, you will start to notice oscillations at lower throttle values.

This step is called mixing.</p><p>It can happen that one of the motor commands becomes negative, for example for a low thrust and large roll command (and similarly it can go above 100%). This is a mixer saturation. It is physically impossible for the vehicle to execute these commands (except for reversible motors). PX4 has two modes to resolve this:</p><ul><li><p>Either by reducing the commanded torque for roll such that none of the motor commands is below zero (Airmode disabled). In the extreme case where the commanded thrust is zero, it means that no attitude correction is possible anymore, which is why a minimum thrust is always required for this mode.</p></li><li><p>Or by increasing (boosting) the commanded thrust, such that none of the motor commands is negative (Airmode enabled). This has the big advantage that the attitude/rates can be tracked correctly even at low or zero throttle. It generally improves the flight performance.</p><p>However it increases the total thrust which can lead to situations where the vehicle continues to ascend even though the throttle is reduced to zero. For a well-tuned, correctly functioning vehicle it is not the case, but for example it can happen when the vehicle strongly oscillates due to too high P tuning gains.</p></li></ul><p>Both modes are shown below with a 2D illustration for two motors and a torque command for roll <span style="color:#9673A6;">r</span>.
