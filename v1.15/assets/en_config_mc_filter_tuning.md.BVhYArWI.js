You can do multiple flights right after each other with different parameters and then inspect all logs, but make sure to disarm in between so that separate log files are created.</p><p>The performed flight maneuver can simply be hovering in <a href="./../flight_modes_mc/manual_stabilized.html">Manual/Stabilized mode</a> with some rolling and pitching to all directions and some increased throttle periods.

Upload the logs to <a href="https://logs.px4.io" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Flight Review</a> and compare the <em>Actuator Controls FFT</em> plot. Set the cutoff frequency to a value before the noise starts to increase noticeably (for frequencies around and above 60 Hz).</p><p>Then tune the D-term filter (<code>IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF</code>) in the same way. Note that there can be negative impacts on performance if <code>IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF</code> and <code>IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF</code> are set too far apart (the differences have to be significant though - e.g. D=15, gyro=80).</p><p>Below is an example for three different <code>IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF</code> filter values (40Hz, 70Hz, 90Hz). At 90 Hz the general noise level starts to increase (especially for roll), and thus a cutoff frequency of 70 Hz is a safe setting. <img src="'+e+'" alt="IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF=40"><img src="'+t+'" alt="IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF=70"><img src="'+a+'" alt="IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF=90"></p><div class="info custom-block"><p class="custom-block-title">INFO</p><p>The plot cannot be compared between different vehicles, as the y axis scale can be different.

In this case you might use the settings: <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#IMU_GYRO_NF0_FRQ">IMU_GYRO_NF0_FRQ=32</a> and <a href="./../advanced_config/parameter_reference.html#IMU_GYRO_NF0_BW">IMU_GYRO_NF0_BW=5</a> (note, this spike is narrower than usual). The low pass filters and the notch filter can be tuned independently (i.e. you don&#39;t need to set the notch filter before collecting the data for tuning the low pass filter).</p><p><img src="'+o+'" alt="IMU_GYRO_NF0_FRQ=32 IMU_GYRO_NF0_BW=5"></p><h2 id="additional-tips" tabindex="-1">Additional Tips <a class="header-anchor" href="#additional-tips" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Additional Tips&quot;">​</a></h2><ol><li><p>Acceptable latency depends on vehicle size and expectations. FPV racers typically tune for the absolute minimal latency (as a ballpark <code>IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF</code> around 120, <code>IMU_DGYRO_CUTOFF</code> of 50 to 80). For bigger vehicles latency is less critical and <code>IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF</code> of around 80 might be acceptable.</p></li><li><p>You can start tuning at higher <code>IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF</code> values (e.g. 100Hz), which might be desirable because the default tuning of <code>IMU_GYRO_CUTOFF</code> is set very low (30Hz).
