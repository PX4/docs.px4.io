The pulse wdith typically ranges between 1000uS for zero power and 2000uS for full power. The periodic frame rate of the signal depends on the capability of the ESC, and commonly ranges between 50Hz and 490 Hz (the theoretical maximum being 500Hz for a very small &quot;off&quot; cycle). A higher rate is better for ESCs, in particular where a rapid response to setpoint changes is needed. For PWM servos 50Hz is usually sufficient, and many don&#39;t support higher rates.</p><p><img src="'+e+'" alt="duty cycle for PWM"></p><p>In addition to being a relatively slow protocol PWM ESCs require <a href="./../advanced_config/esc_calibration.html">calibration</a> because the range values representing low and high values can vary significantly.

There are a number of variants of the OneShot protocol, which support different rates.
