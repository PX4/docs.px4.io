Unlike when using a module such as the U-blox F9P, where you would need <a href="./../gps_compass/u-blox_f9p_heading.html">two U-blox F9P modules to compute a heading angle</a>, with the Unicore UM982 GPS, you only need one GPS module!</p><p>Using this GPS as a yaw source, instead of a compass, prevents magnetic interference from causing incorrect yaw reports to the autopilot (compasses are commonly affected by the vehicle motors and electrical systems, and other environmental interference sources such as metallic structures or equipment). This works even if the GPSs are not receiving RTCM data from a fixed RTK station or NTRIP server. It supports RTK positioning adjustment for centimeter-level accuracy, GPS/GLONASS,Beidou, Galileo, and QZSS global positioning systems.</p><p>The module also includes a magnetometer, LED, and safety switch button. It also serves as an RTK-corrected vehicle GPS, with or without moving baseline yaw determination, and as a base station GPS for sending RTCM data to a ground control station to provide an RTK source for the vehicle via telemetry.</p><p>Additional technical information can be found at <a href="https://docs.holybro.com/gps-and-rtk-system/h-rtk-unicore-um982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Holybro Technical Documentation page</a></p><h2 id="where-to-buy" tabindex="-1">Where to Buy <a class="header-anchor" href="#where-to-buy" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Where to Buy&quot;">​</a></h2><ul><li><a href="https://holybro.com/products/h-rtk-um982" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Holybro Website</a></li></ul><h2 id="wiring" tabindex="-1">Wiring <a class="header-anchor" href="#wiring" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Wiring&quot;">​</a></h2><p>The module comes with both GH 10-pin &amp; 6-pin cables that are compatible with the GPS1 &amp; GPS2 ports on flight controllers that use the <a href="https://github.com/pixhawk/Pixhawk-Standards/blob/master/DS-009%20Pixhawk%20Connector%20Standard.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Pixhawk Connector Standard</a>, such as <a href="./../flight_controller/pixhawk6x.html">Pixhawk 6x</a> and <a href="./../flight_controller/pixhawk6c.html">Pixhawk 6c</a>.</p><p>It can also be used with Cubepilot Flight Controller. The 10Pin - 6Pin cable allows users to connect the UM982 to <code>GPS2</code> port on Cubepilot and Holybro Autopilots.</p><p>The module can be used with one antenna or both antennas.
