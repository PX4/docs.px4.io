Vehicle state information includes: position/altitude, heading, speed, airspeed, orientation (attitude), rates of rotation in different directions, battery level, and so on.</p><p>PX4 <em>minimally requires</em> a gyroscope, accelerometer, magnetometer (compass), and barometer to measure the above states. Fixed-wing and VTOL-vehicles <em>should</em> also include an airspeed sensor. A GPS or other positioning system is needed to enable all automatic modes, and some manual/assisted modes.</p><p><a href="./../flight_controller/pixhawk_series.html">Pixhawk Series</a> flight controllers already have the minimum set of sensors (other controller platforms often do too). Additional/external sensors can be attached to the controller — an external GPS and compass are recommended, along with an airspeed sensor for VTOL and Fixed wing vehicles.</p><h2 id="sensor-topics" tabindex="-1">Sensor Topics <a class="header-anchor" href="#sensor-topics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Sensor Topics&quot;">​</a></h2><p>Mandatory (included in Pixhawk series FCs):</p><ul><li><a href="./../sensor/accelerometer.html">Accelerometer</a> — Measures changing acceleration.</li><li><a href="./../sensor/gyroscope.html">Gyroscope</a> — Measures orientation.</li><li><a href="./../gps_compass/magnetometer.html">Magnetometer (Compass)</a> — Measures heading/direction.
